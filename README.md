# Discord Bot

![What is Morpho?](https://cdn.morpho.org/images/morpho-gpt/what-is-morpho.png)

## Description

This Discord bot was built to answer questions posed by users in a specific Discord channel. It uses [OpenAI's GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference), [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), and [Langchain](https://langchain.io/) to process and answer questions. The bot embeds user questions, queries a Pinecone vector store for the most relevant documents, and then uses GPT-3.5 to generate an answer from those documents.

The bot relies on a repository of .txt and .md files that contain the knowledge base used to answer questions. Each of these files start with a link and a title in the two first lines of the document.
For example:
file.md
line 1: Link: https://example.documentation
line 2: Title: Example Documentation
line 3: ...

These two lines are used for display purposes in Discord. The bot uses the text from these documents, along with the provided link, to construct responses to user queries.

## Project Structure

The core of the project is divided into four main TypeScript files in the `./src` folder.:

- `bot.ts`: Initializes the Discord bot and handles command interactions.
- `read/routeDiscord.ts`: Handles the read commands from the Discord chat.
- `setup/routeDiscord.ts`: Handles the setup check of the Pinecone index.
- `cli/cli.ts`: Handles the cli commands to monitor thanks to the workflow action.
- `services/interfaces.ts`: Handling the interfaces.
- `services/pinecone.ts`: Handling pinecone related functions.
- `services/cli.ts`: Handling cli related commands.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following:

- Node.js and npm installed on your local environment
- Discord API Key
- Pinecone API Key
- GPT-3.5 API Key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the project dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and populate it with your API keys and the name of the env & index on pinecone:

```bash
- OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
- PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
- PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_pinecone_environment
- PINECONE_INDEX=your_pinecone_index
- DISCORD_API_KEY=your_discord_key
- SPECIFIC_CHANNEL_ID=your_specific_channel
```

4. Compile TypeScript code:
   ```bash
   npm run tsc
   ```
5. Start the bot:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Usage

You can ask the bot a question in any Discord channel where it's present by typing /question Your question here. For example:

/question What is the Documentation about?

The bot will then compute an answer and respond in the channel. The bot's response includes a relevant chunk of text from the queried documents and a link to the source document. Please note that we are restricting queries to 1 per minute.

## Docker Deployment

5. Build the Docker image:

```bash
   docker build -t my-discord-bot .
```

6. Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --env-file ./.env my-discord-bot
```

## Documentation

All documentation to build the bot's knowledge base should be in .txt or .md files. The two first lines in each document must start with "Link" and "Title" for display purposes on Discord. This format allows the bot to include the source link and title in its responses.
