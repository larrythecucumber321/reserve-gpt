Title: Smart Contracts Overview

The [system design](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/master/docs/system-design.md) document in our Github [repository](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol) provides an overview of the smart contracts architecture and details about the protocol implementation.

The Protocol Operations chapter explains how these contracts work together to provide the core functionality of the protocol.
