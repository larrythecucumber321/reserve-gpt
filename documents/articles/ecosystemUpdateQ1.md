Title: Reserve Ecosystem Update ‚Äî 2023 Q1

Hello and welcome to the Reserve Ecosystem Update!

In this blog post we‚Äôre going to recap everything that happened with Reserve in 2023 so far. Get ready to learn about:

Putting your RSR to work and earning rewards
The questionable incentives of outdated banking systems and alternatives to it via Nevin‚Äôs latest CoinDesk article.
The IMF giving Reserve some well-deserved praise
The ongoing hackathon ‚Äî it‚Äôs in full swing and we want you there!
Put your RSR to work, earn rewards üëÄ
RSR staking on eUSD, the first RToken created by MobileCoin, is available now!

By participating in governance and overcollateralization of eUSD, all RSR holders can earn a share of the revenue it generates, with rewards increasing alongside the RToken‚Äôs market cap. As of last week, RSR staking yield sits at an attractive 5.2%.

High APY stable pair LPing? Yes please! üí∏
In order for eUSD to be smoothly traded on the blockchain, users need to provide liquidity (LP) on decentralized exchanges for it and any tokens it can be traded against. In return for doing so, they earn part of the trading fees + extra incentives.

Exciting news for stable pair LPers! The new eUSD+FRAX/USDC Curve pool has been live since February 27th, and rewards for eUSD LPing on Curve started on March 23rd.

But that‚Äôs not all ‚Äî Convex rewards have since kicked in, allowing for even higher APYs for those who choose to LP in this pool. With Reserve‚Äôs top 10 Convex voting power, juicy yields await!

Reserve Ecosystem Highlights
Through the Reserve Gitcoin hackathon, 24 new collateral tokens are soon to be added as backing for RTokens, ranging from liquid staking derivatives such as stETH & cbETH to various yield-bearing DeFi lending positions across protocols such as Convex, Goldfinch, Yearn, and more. It‚Äôs not too late to join! Developers can win from a NEW hackathon pool of $70,000 by helping expand the Reserve ecosystem.

On February 23, the Reserve Protocol reached the All Clear status after passing five rigorous audits. With the core engineering team‚Äôs confidence in larger inflows of capital across various RTokens, we‚Äôve seen over $15 million deployed into the protocol.

Right after the All Clear, the Electronic Dollar (eUSD), built with Reserve Protocol, officially launched on the Ethereum & MobileCoin blockchains. Since then it has not only been integrated within the MOBY app and Curve, but has also replaced RSV in the Reserve app (‚ÄúRPay‚Äù) in LATAM entirely, giving 100,000s of people and merchants access to dollar-pegged, 1:1 asset-backed and overcollateralized stable currency in an ever-growing list of countries.

We‚Äôre thrilled to have been part of ETHDenver, where Reserve co-hosted three events, including a successful hackathon to encourage RToken deployments. We had a great time engaging with the community, discussing the latest developments in the blockchain industry, and networking with other like-minded individuals. Wanna dive deeper? Check out this overview from Reserve @ ETHDenver.

Shortly after its launch, eUSD faced its first real test during the USDC depegging. However, the resilience of the Reserve Protocol was clearly demonstrated as eUSD weathered the storm. Read our full report here and learn about how eUSD is pioneering self-healing stablecoins.

What are we up to this Spring? Our engineering team shifts its focus towards building collateral plugins to expand the possibilities of asset-backed currencies. This will enable the deployment of several new community-driven RTokens and give RSR stakers more options to participate in governance and grow the ecosystem! You can help with these efforts by referring stablecoin enthusiasts, strategists, monetary policy experts, and governance specialists to our $70,000 Hackathon ‚Äî no-coding experience required.

We will also be attending EthCC in Paris mid-July. Would you like to join us? Drop into Discord and let us know.
