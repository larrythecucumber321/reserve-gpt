Title: Introducing Community Education Rewards

Reserve, the permissionless asset-backed currency protocol, is growing its ecosystem. The protocol’s mission is to increase adoption of, and expand access to sustainable, inflation proof, stable currency.

Currently, the protocol hosts 3 main RTokens. High Yield USD (hyUSD), a secure high yield savings dollar offering up to 8% APY. ETHPlus (ETH+) is a safety-first diversified ETH staking index with up to 4.5% APY. These tokens feature the same self-healing properties as eUSD, which recently demonstrated its resilience by autonomously recovering from the USDC depeg.

After last week’s announcement, today’s post outlines the next step in achieving Reserve’s mission.

The protocol is excited to announce community members sharing their Reserve ecosystem expertise through public content can enjoy part of at a monthly rewards pool of at least $2,100 paid in eUSD. Note that Reserve is not afraid to show contributors more than this figure if submissions knock it out of the park.

This initiative aims to foster a vibrant ecosystem of learning and collaboration about Reserve where everyone has the opportunity to both learn and receive recognition for their efforts.

As outlined in the initial forum post, this process is experimental and subject to change. The first trial will last 6 months, and will be refined throughout the process- we welcome feedback to improve!

Content can be submitted on the form at the bottom of this post between the 1st and the 20th of each month, after which it’ll be reviewed by the Reserve core team. The ~5 submissions that add the most to the Reserve ecosystem will be spotlighted on the @reserveprotocol Twitter and receive a share of the monthly rewards (the size of individual rewards will be at the discretion of the core team).

Please note that submissions must comply with certain “guardrails”:

A maximum of 1 piece of content per person will be eligible for rewards each month
RSR price content of any kind will be disqualified
Low-effort recycling of earlier content (e.g. basic explanations) will be disqualified — this includes raw ChatGPT summaries
Podcasts/keynotes/community calls where Reserve is the guest will be disqualified
Winners of any of the monthly rewards will need to complete the required tax form before being able to receive their reward (W-9 for US citizen/resident W-8BEN for non-US person)
Why launch this program?
Knowledge sharing is key to any DeFi protocol. This program aims to activate thought leadership in Reserve’s community and distinguish the good from the great. Reserve is also very excited at the prospect of community members collaborating with one another, and perhaps creating new ideas of their own.

Awareness for DeFi protocols is largely gained via social media channels such as Crypto Twitter, and we believe an education rewards program like this will incentivize the content creators to evangelize Reserve, resulting in an inflow of contributors aligned with Reserve’s goals.

Content submission wishlist
This program welcomes all submissions, but pieces will ideally consider the following points:

It could be about RTokens (as introduced above), the protocol in general or anything that might bring value to those curious about Reserve.

Content Relevance: Is the content relevant and useful for the Reserve community? Does it offer unique insights? Is the content accurate and demonstrates balance? Thoughtless endorsements are not conducive to good discussion.

Impact: Will the content have a significant impact on the ecosystem? Is it presented respectfully and considerate of different learning capacities? Does it further Reserve’s mission of helping others?

Creativity: Does the content showcase originality? Does it present ideas in an engaging way? Are relevant visual aids used?

Technical Depth: Does the content go beyond surface-level explanations? Does it relate them to the wider context?

Note that this is not an exhaustive list of priorities and the Reserve team looks forward to receiving contributions that push the envelope in a thoughtful manner. Use this as a jumping off point!

Closing thoughts
In this post we’ve outlined the details for Reserve’s Community Education Rewards. Reserve is engaging its community and the ecosystem at large to bring it together and activate its best and brightest to share in the spirit of learning. Reserve is excited to see what the existing community and new contributors have to share with each other — as soon as this post goes live!

This program is live effective immediately! Join the discord and visit the #community-content channel’s pinned message for the link to the form.
