Asimov Collective is a creative studio that works with partners who are developing transformative technology, broadening philosophical frontiers and building American Dynamism. When we began working with the Reserve team to develop a new brand presence for the Reserve Protocol, we started with a deep technical dive to understand what the protocol actually does, and why it needs to exist. The Reserve project is ultimately about expanding access to stable currency to every human being. To achieve this goal, the team knew that a methodical development process was necessary, and the project’s goals couldn’t be tied to the hype cycles that characterize the broader crypto industry. Since 2017 the team has been heads down building the tech stack, and along the way standalone products emerged including the RPay app which has supported billions of dollars in transactions in countries experiencing financial instability.

The Reserve Protocol is the result of those years of patient, focused work to create something safe, intuitive and fundamentally useful for the world. Our team soon realized there were two strong narratives within the project, one springing from the diverse and talented team that built the protocol itself, and another from the millions of ordinary people whose lives are already being transformed by the technology ecosystem the protocol is going to massively amplify. This focus on breakthrough technology with real, tangible impact stands out in a noisy DeFi field, so we knew we needed to do something unique to capture these twin spirits of the project.

Blueprint for a Decentralized Factory

The Reserve project is a sophisticated ecosystem composed of many component parts. Each of those parts operate independently but also must work symbiotically with others. It is decentralized by design. At its best, this kind of system can massively empower engineers, tinkerers and pioneers to utilize the best technologies to create tools and projects they think need to exist in the world. The Protocol is meant to slot into this ecosystem and supercharge it. We saw this as a kind of factory. It must be clearly organized so that a new participant can quickly orient themselves, and it must enable efficient communication and connectivity between the various components.

We developed a unique grid system inspired by factory blueprints that is composed of modular blocks. Each individual block can connect to the others and based on a shared logic, forming a coherent whole greater than the sum of their parts. This system serves as the framework for the reserve protocol design system.

Poetry in the Machine

While the protocol is a sleek piece of software machinery, the impact it has on the world is tangible in human terms. The flow of money undergirds the entire world economy, but billions of people around the world are trapped using money whose value varies dramatically year to year, or sometimes even month to month! If a better system existed, human lives could flourish and we could unleash the power of industry and technology to build a better world. Symbiotically industrial eco-landscapes, biotechnology that revolutionizes human health and terraformed garden colonies on distant worlds. We wanted to capture this vision of WHAT the protocol could enable and do this in a way that also reinforced the care and craft that the digital artisans on the Reserve team put into the protocol over many years.

We did this through a series of very detailed hand drawn illustrations that come together to form a quilt of the future, a quilt that is seamlessly integrated into the underlying grid framework. Each of the vignettes has a story that the Reserve Protocol could enable, and like all decentralized systems, each of these will require the agency and initiative of bold and visionary teams. At the end of the day it will be individuals and teams of humans who build this optimistic future, so we felt that the hand drawn technique would ultimately bring the focus back to the real people whose lives can be positively changed by the Reserve Protocol.

#0151AF

Reserve Blue is the hallmark of the brand aesthetic. Across a complex ecosystem of interlocking players and tools, we knew we would need to minimize noise. We asked the question, “can there be a single, unifying element that allows vastly different components and systems to be tied together?” We took inspiration from Yves Klein and his singular use of blue across all kinds of artistic mediums. This formed the foundation of the Reserve brand which links the technical blueprint graphics and the poetic narrative scenes. The hue we chose, #0151AF, is a balance between a deep oceanic navy that is vast and serious, and a saturated cobalt that is energetic and tech-forward. To our team this communicates a calm confidence that can only come from years of focused work.

Looking Forward

All in all — the Reserve Brand System is a framework meant to evolve with the brand over time. With all of our work, our hope is to create something timeless. The great works of architecture or art we love persist through time, continuously cared for by the people who are inspired by the spirit of the work. We hope that the path we took to communicate the ideas and values of the Reserve team continues to cultivate a culture that is as robust and foundational as the Reserve Protocol itself.
