Asset Backed Currencies for Everyone
The Reserve Protocol is now LIVE on Base, marking its first expansion beyond Ethereum mainnet. Why does this matter? It empowers accessible innovation.

The low-cost, developer-friendly Ethereum L2 environment launched by Coinbase affords a streamlined and low-friction experience for experimentation with decentralized currency. With the Reserve Protocol, participants in the Base ecosystem now have the tools to sculpt their own decentralized and fully-backed currencies (“RTokens”).

“This launch brings self-healing currency to Base.”

DeFi should expand far beyond a few thousand power users. Base’s lower transaction fees will enable people who are interested in using yield bearing stablecoins to actually use them without having all benefits wiped out by gas costs. We want to see millions of RToken users on Base!

Ever had a great idea for a stablecoin? How about a flatcoin or an index? Reserve encourages the curious to let their economic imagination run wild. RTokens (the product of using the Reserve Protocol) give deployers freedom to realize these dreams by customizing a wide array of parameters such as revenue sharing, asset backing and emergency collateral. With Base’s lightning-fast speeds and negligible fees, it’s possible countless experiments will take place.

RTokens deployed on Base are equipped with the same resilient mechanisms shown by their counterparts on mainnet. You may recall how the Electronic Dollar (eUSD) was able to autonomously recover its $1 peg following the USDC depeg earlier in 2023. This launch brings self-healing currency to Base.

Across both Ethereum and Base, countless collateral options exist for deployers, including major stablecoins, ETH and wBTC; both on their own, and in yield-bearing forms from protocols such as Compound, MakerDAO, Aave, Convex, Curve, Morpho, Stargate and Flux Finance.

We call on dreamers and doers to explore the ABC Factory today on Register, empowered by the uniquely low-cost and fast environment offered on Base. Reserve Protocol contributors would be delighted to chat about your ideas on Discord.

RSR continues to serve as the governance token and first loss capital for RTokens on Base and can be found here:
