Introduction
The challenges faced by treasury management in DAOs are well-documented. Ultimately, the goal of a DAO should be to maximize ecosystem growth and sustainability. As a consequence of most DAOs not having the resources or capacity for complex financial management and keeping up with complex DeFi products, these DAOs have been shy to allocate capital.

Traditionally, DAOs maintain a substantial allocation of their native token which might be liquidated to meet operational demands and ensure a cash runway, an action which is often in conflict with the interests of token voters. The trials endured through fluctuating market cycles have shown DAOs the importance of diversification into stablecoins and ETH/BTC. However, there is room for improvement — DAO treasuries can, and should, be productive.

This article suggests a new path towards efficiency in DAO treasury management by aligning with treasury management strategies widely accepted in the broader tech industry. These strategies are conveniently encapsulated in decentralized asset-backed and yield-bearing RTokens on the Reserve Protocol.

Current State & Needs of DAO Treasuries
Venture capital firm a16z has published an excellent article advocating for a principled and conservative approach to treasury management for DAOs, gleaned from their experience with 1000+ startups. Operating cash should be positioned to become more conducive to long-term growth as time horizons lengthen:

Nevertheless, the largest DAO treasuries (despite having well over 18 months of runway) continue to hold their assets almost entirely in unproductive assets. The chart below illustrates the breakdown of the top 10 largest DAO treasuries (according to data from Token Terminal) by whether assets are held in yield-bearing assets or not. Notably, only two DAOs in this list hold a majority of their assets in yield-bearing positions (kudos to Aave and Nouns!).

Missed Growth by DAO Treasuries
This pattern of holding assets in non-yielding assets represents missed growth opportunities for DAOs. Let’s consider Rook, which has its treasury entirely in non-yield-bearing assets. By strategically diversifying its holdings into yield-bearing assets, Rook could have seen significant growth. Investing its ETH and stablecoin holdings at market rates of 4% and 7% respectively, Rook DAO’s treasury could have expanded by $1.1M within a year. The chart below illustrates this potential growth.

RTokens and How They Satisfy Treasury Needs
Enter the Reserve Protocol — a permissionless platform for building, deploying and governing asset-backed currencies known as “RTokens.” RTokens maintain a 1:1 asset-backed ratio, enabling permissionless minting and redemption on-chain by users, eliminating the need for intermediaries. Overcollateralization is provided by RSR governance token stakers. Importantly, each RToken is separately governed by a focused community of vigilant stakers.

Currently, the protocol hosts a range of diversified, yield-bearing RTokens. High Yield USD (hyUSD), a secure high yield savings dollar offering up to 8% APY, is expected to surpass inflation rates in more than 100 countries globally. ETHPlus (ETH+) is a safety-first diversified ETH staking index with up to 4.5% APY. These tokens feature the same self-healing properties as eUSD, which recently demonstrated its resilience by autonomously recovering from the USDC depeg.

The above features demonstrate that RTokens are a fitting candidate for inclusion in DAO treasuries. RTokens offer multiple advantages that address their core needs:

Liquidity: RTokens are instantly redeemable for the underlying assets and additionally have ample secondary market liquidity, ensuring DAOs can promptly fulfill their operational obligations. DAOs retain full agency and control over their funds held in RTokens.
Capital Preservation: RTokens offer diversified exposure to blue-chip assets with extensive on-chain liquidity, thus mitigating risk. Further, RSR overcollateralization offers a safety net against black swan events.
Growth: As yield-bearing assets, RTokens enable DAOs to earn passive income on their holdings, helping them achieve their growth objectives. Underlying yield is autonomously compounded by Reserve Protocol operations to accelerate growth.
The importance of the Capital Preservation features of RTokens to DAOs cannot be understated. The overcollateralization of RTokens, combined with the configuration of backup emergency collateral, creates a robust and autonomous safety mechanism. This mechanism guards against bank runs and is not subject to the delays often experienced in multi-day governance procedures during black swan events. Consider the recent ENS DAO crisis: in the face of a bank run on SVB, their community was thrown into a state of panic — a scenario that could have been averted entirely had they held eUSD, an RToken, instead of USDC.

Conclusion
While traditional methods of holding native tokens may have worked in the past, the need for growth and stability in DAO treasuries necessitates a paradigm shift. Just as holding Aave aTokens isn’t condemned as “farming with the treasury”, holding risk-diversified, yield-bearing assets should gain wider acceptance as communities begin to appreciate that there is a wide-ranging risk curve. Failure to do so means leaving money on the table and missing out on growth.

RTokens deployed from the Reserve Protocol present an attractive solution to the core needs of DAO treasuries. They offer instant liquidity, capital preservation, and passive growth, which are fundamental to any successful treasury management strategy. It’s time to rethink old strategies and fully leverage the dynamic, maturing landscape of DeFi. The future of DAO treasuries is productive, and it begins with RTokens.
