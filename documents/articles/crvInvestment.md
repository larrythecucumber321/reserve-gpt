Title: Reserve’s DeFi investment

Jun 21, 2023

Reserve is making an investment in Curve Finance (CRV), Convex Finance (CVX), and Stake DAO (SDT) governance ecosystems.

Reserve is a platform that facilitates the permissionless creation of asset-backed currencies, called “RTokens”. A crucial factor for the successful adoption of RTokens is the availability of sufficient on-chain liquidity, as a large part of their demand may come from blockchain-native participants such as DAOs or other protocols.

Today, we’re thrilled to announce that Reserve will be investing $20 million in the Curve ecosystem aiming to enhance RToken liquidity even further. In this blog post we’ll be covering what this means exactly and how it impacts stakeholders within the Reserve ecosystem.

What is Reserve doing?

Reserve’s treasury allocated $20 million to purchase CRV, CVX and SDT tokens. These purchases have been occurring for the past few weeks and will continue to occur through summer. Given the current market landscape, owning these assets becomes appealing due to favorable entry positions — which provide the opportunity for long-term influence in the Curve ecosystem’s governance.

In the interest of efficient execution, these purchases will be conducted in the most discreet manner. Nevertheless, knowledgeable on-chain actors are taking note.

The first three RTokens created on Reserve include High Yield USD (hyUSD): a high-yield savings dollar with up to 8% APY, backed by Convex Finance and Flux Finance yield bearing stable assets. ETHPlus (ETH+): a safety-first diversified ETH staking index with up to 4.5% APY backed by Lido Staked ETH and Rocket Pool ETH. Electronic Dollar (eUSD): an anti-fragile stablecoin built to endure black swan events and backed by a diversified basket of yield-bearing, trusted stablecoin derivatives utilizing Compound and Aave.

This strategic investment will assist in boosting the liquidity of community created RTokens initially, but may include more assets as the ecosystem further matures.

Why is Reserve buying these assets?

Reserve is a protocol that enables anyone to create asset-backed currencies. For RTokens to succeed, many different factors need to be adequately satisfied. For example, the currency must trend towards stability and be easily convertible into another currency. It should also strive to be widely accepted and trusted. Most importantly, these assets should strive to be liquid.

Reserve is allocating investments towards CRV, CVX and SDT governance in order to encourage a liquid and sustainable RToken ecosystem.

Liquidity is paramount in both traditional and decentralized finance as it enables easy trading and investment for market participants, which reduces friction and risk. As RToken liquidity depth and distribution grows, RTokens will become more integrated across DeFi supporting a broader ecosystem of DAOs, entrepreneurs, protocols, apps, and institutions.

Without sufficient liquidity, the RToken financial system could be less efficient, grow slower and would be more prone to shocks. This strategic investment helps mitigate the likelihood of these issues becoming a problem from the outset and maximizes the prospects for a healthy ecosystem.

How will buying these assets facilitate deeper liquidity?

Reserve is diversifying its investments across CRV, CVX and SDT, leveraging the unique characteristics of each asset such as locking lengths, voting power, and admin fee access. This approach aims to maximize the impact within the governance system. Additionally, each asset will play a role in incentivizing liquidity provision by utilizing the ecosystem’s gauge mechanism, thus directing it towards RToken pools on Curve.

As of today’s writing, liquidity providers are already capturing ~10–25% for current RTokens on Curve and Convex. Reserve’s aim is to support unique, secure and well-considered RTokens, aiding the most high quality participants with deep liquidity.

Closing thoughts

This investment is the next step in Reserve’s commitment to building a sustainable and liquid ecosystem for permissionless RTokens.
