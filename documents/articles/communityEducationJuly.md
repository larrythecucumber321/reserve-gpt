Title: Community Education Rewards: July winners

The month of July witnessed an impressive display of creativity and talent from the Reserve ecosystem, and the time has come to announce the winners. As outlined in the initial blogpost, content that was relevant, creative, impactful and possessing sufficient technical depth would be prioritized.

Join us in celebrating contributions that have set the standard in educational content development. The overall winner will be announced first and then will be followed by other worthy submissions in no particular order. Community members will be pleased to know that this month saw so many good submissions that over $3,000 was awarded, substantially higher than the initial monthly goal for community education rewards.

This month’s grand prize went to [DeFiMadeHere’s](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Made_Here/status/1673727467503210497?s=20) piece explaining the value proposition of RTokens. This piece was highly relevant and focused on a variety of timely and material topics. These include how RTokens function, the three main RTokens, how RTokens are overcollateralized, Reserve Curve strategy and a fair evaluation of strengths and weaknesses of the Reserve system — such as the complexity the protocol will face if it is to become a meaningful reserve currency.

This piece had a noticeable impact on Twitter with 38,000 views and included well-explained diagrams. The level of technical depth was also spot on as it was nuanced but not overcomplicated. Well done to DeFiMadeHere!

Other notable awarded submissions include:

[SchizoXBT’s](https://twitter.com/schizoxbt/status/1673987101598294021?s=46&t=rv4etRTi61EchLqUNpjQng) 3 part series on Reserve, deep diving topics like overcollateralization, yield and other opportunities exclusive to the Reserve ecosystem.
[DeFi Vaults’s](https://twitter.com/defivaults/status/1678252499160145922?s=61&t=DurRFeTMENiqwE87909Hww) primer on how ETH+ could have mitigated the June ’22 stETH depeg crisis.
[Tom Sawyer’s](https://tomsawyer.substack.com/p/beginning-to-redefine-money) latest installment into the High Yield Times on the changing nature of money, the dawn of flatcoins, the opportunities that they bring and how DeFi might position itself to benefit.
[0xCliffBooth’s Substack](https://0xcliff.substack.com/p/rtokens-diversification) / Twitter thread combo that focused heavily on the merits of diversifying your funds, drawing inspiration from TradFi titans Vanguard as well as DeFi specific minutiae like aggregated staking yields.
All those involved will be receiving rewards for their remarkable efforts, with a special acknowledgement to DeFiMadeHere for their outstanding contribution. A big round of applause to everyone!
