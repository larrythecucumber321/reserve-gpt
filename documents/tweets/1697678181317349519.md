Let's start with our leading light for the month: @eli5_defi.

Their post starts out by introducing users to Reserve.  It continues with a top to bottom examination of challenges RTokens face, stablecoin design considerations, how RSR overcollateralization works and so on. https://t.co/zfbeXDJxrY

The community especially liked the custom made diagrams that are extremely helpful, and the close attention to making sure that sources were available. See the tweet below explaining the USDC depeg!

The following post cites @Blockworks_'s Reserve report as an example! https://t.co/byFFxs9oHL

The second leading light of the month is none other than @0xMughal's incredible video given Reserve a once-over.

This 30 minute piece, alongside his thoughtful thread about Reserve's curve strategy earn him a proud home amongst the best educators in the Reserve community. https://t.co/FxLa5ocCst

The educational video, linked below, is very accessible. Video is an especially important medium to Reserve, and so attention is paid to submissions like these.

Contributors are well aware of the huge work that goes into something like this. A big hand to @0xMughal for this! https://t.co/mw2HGHGDvd

Following this is @AltcoinistDAO's examination of Reserve's suitability as a "flatcoin factory". One of @brian_armstrong's recent startup ideas, a flatcoin is an inflation resistant currency.

Altcoinist DAO's post educates the community about how RTokens fit this bill. https://t.co/QgHp6PpOml

7/

Special attention should be paid to the DAO's careful use of strong details in this piece.

The piece also does a good job at contextualizing the need for flatcoins and then explains how RTokens fit this using Reserve diagrams.

Thanks to AltcoinistDAO for their contribution!

Coming up next is @dserrano01 piece discussing collateral types.

No other content has covered this important issue yet, and so it earns a place among the greats.

The originality and the frequent visual aids help address a new but critical topic. Well done to Mr K! https://t.co/0SqPfELsWE

Another original piece is Community Education Rewards old timer @0xCliffBooth. This submission covers how RTokens can be used to power public goods - yet another novel idea. https://t.co/N5xaDqgfLh

10/

Cliff's piece is filled with excellent diagrams and clear language. It also suggests existing protocols like @Giveth, and then goes on to explain how RTokens may have product market fit with them.

After all, who doesn't like public goods? https://t.co/EmvCsLt1rD

This month's penultimate winner is Sergio's submission about his thoughts on ETH+. Custom diagrams, thoughtful critiques supported by statistics and potential for growth all make a convincing and balanced post. Sergio's educational writing really is up there with the best! https://t.co/q85puGJ6aT

12/

And last but by no means least is @melojuanS4URUS's contribution. This piece is another perspective on Reserve's trajectory. They've been tracking RToken yields for a while now and indicate some positive early signs for a new product. https://t.co/e7ZFaAEfJJ

And that concludes this month's winners! Well done all who submitted and don't forget that next month's competition is already live! As a point of reference, see how July's program went here.

Looking forward to seeing the new submissions! https://t.co/67BYtOlBoB
