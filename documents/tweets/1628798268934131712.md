We have an important announcement to make:

‚Ä¶Reserve has reached the ALL CLEAR MILESTONE https://t.co/bYJXyLcDnL

2/17

This version of Reserve‚Äôs rigorously audited and tested codebase kicks off our journey of enabling stable, asset-backed currencies for the world.

And in this post, we‚Äôll explain how you can take part! üî•

In this thread...

- The All Clear Milestone  
- What Does Today Mean? 
- What Comes Next?

All Clear Milestone üî• 

Reserve Protocol was initially launched in Bogot√° last October. 

Since last July, we have engaged in five audits, along with constant internal testing, to provide RToken deployers and holders the most robust version of the protocol possible.

5/17

Our five auditors:

- Ackee
- Trail Of Bits
- Halborn
- Solidified
- Code4rena public audit

6/17

With this week's deployment of v2.0.0 of the protocol, we reach a version where we feel comfortable deploying capital into, and a version we feel comfortable inviting others to as well.

7/17

What does today mean?

From today, Reserve Protocol provides a permissionless platform for anyone to create yield-bearing, asset-backed currencies üåé

8/17

We call them RTokens, and they:

- are backed 1:1 by a diversified basket of any tokenized asset, including fiat stablecoins, any asset deployed into defi, and tokenized real world assets 

- provide programmable rev sharing across holders, stakers, or Ethereum addresses

9/17

- are censorship-resistant

- have proof of reserves on-chain, 24/7

- are over-collateralized and governed by the community in a fully decentralized way.

10/17

And today you will see press around the launch of our first RToken, the $eUSD - already deployed by @mobilecoin!

You can check it out at üëâ https://t.co/XnuGIPj2Op

11/17

As RTokens are deployed and TVLs increase, you may see reasons to stake $RSR on them.

RSR stakers earn revenue from yield-bearing collaterals in exchange for over-collateralization, protecting against defaults.

We ask holders to inspect RTokens and make choices wisely!

12/17

And, with our Reserve cautiousness, even though we have tested rigorously: as with all new smart contracts, please proceed at your own risk.

This baby is new to the world!

13/17

Our goal is enabling the world to find alternatives to inflation-prone currencies, giving everyone in the world the power to maintain their purchasing power across time, and across borders.

14/17

In the beginning, we are looking to collaborate with the defi community to unlock the power of programmable money, through methods such as:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Creative RTokens designs
2Ô∏è‚É£ Collateral plugin development
3Ô∏è‚É£ RTokens integrations into defi

15/17

So for those attending #EthDenver, we are holding a $70k Hackathon ‚ö°Ô∏è

Come join us and build!

What comes next?

Today, the pendulum swings from "quietly building" to "letting the world in", as we help foster the adoption of asset-backed currency, useable by all, with a focus on stability over time.

17/17

We invite all builders, heroes and dreamers...

who can see a world where money is stable and useable over decades, and want to make that a reality
