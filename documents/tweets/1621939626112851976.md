2/5 Reserve's permissionless platform allows anyone to create an asset-backed currency, and @mobilecoin's mission is to make global payments inexpensive, secure and fast.

Listen in as we discuss where we think the future of money is going as we head towards eUSD's launch.

3/5 Once deployed and in the @moby_app, eUSD can be sent to any smartphone in the world, with:

- settlements under 5 seconds
- a fixed fraction of a cent cost, regardless of transaction size
- privacy and data-protection at every step

4/5 On #Ethereum, eUSD takes full advantage of an RToken's programmable money powers, including:

- 1:1 backing by a diverse and flexible basket of assets
- 24/7 on-chain proof of reserves
- Decentralized safety-motivated governance
- Over-collateralization by $RSR stakers

5/5 Find out more about us both at https://t.co/iketdXCPxe and https://t.co/7AjNGfi4By and stay tuned for further details!
