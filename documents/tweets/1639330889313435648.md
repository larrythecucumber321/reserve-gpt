1/ eUSD has emerged strong from a trial by fire 🔥

What exactly happened though?

In this post, we pop open the RToken hood to understand their self-healing mechanisms 🚗

We discuss two key RToken processes w/ the help of diagrams:
1. Basket Switch
2. Re-collateralization

🧵👇 https://t.co/HcpVyUSxCo

2/ The BasketHandler (BH) is a smart contract responsible for managing an RToken's basket configuration

When a collateral asset defaults, the BH must recognize this and spring into action to re-configure a healthy basket. This diagram explains how, which we break down 👇 https://t.co/3gKK2r4xrb

3/ Basket Switch Step 1: Issue Detected 🔎

Select user actions trigger a refresh on the status of underlying RToken collateral marking them SOUND or DISABLED based on default checks

See a live stream of a community member triggering this check on eUSD: https://t.co/AXwzKc3wfk https://t.co/aYKFUf8hsn

4/ Step 2: Refresh Basket 🧺

Calling refreshBasket on the BasketHandler checks whether any collateral was marked DISABLED in step 1

If so, the BasketHandler switches DISABLED collateral for emergency collateral 🚨

... But how? https://t.co/6itvM1GXTv

5/ Step 3: Basket Switch 🔄

RToken collateral is defined having a target unit (USD, BTC, etc)

This forms distinct parts of the basket for which different emergency collateral is defined

The below process is repeated for every target unit (e.g. eUSD only has USD collateral) https://t.co/hqwlT2pDOS

6/ Step 3 cont...

The weights of SOUND collateral are calculated relative to  TOTAL collateral weight

In eUSD's case, 50% of the collateral was unsound and needed replacing

Of the emergency collateral, only USDT was healthy, leading to this new basket:

7/ Basket Switch Concludes ✅

At this point, the BasketHandler has set a new RToken basket based on the newly introduced emergency collateral and its weight(s)

However, no $$$ has moved yet...

... This is the job for the BackingManager, who manages Re-collateralization https://t.co/jseoOOA0Ra

8/ Re-collateralization Step 1: Check Path

The BackingManager (BM) is also responsible for processing revenue along w/ re-collateralization - learn about RToken revenue handling here https://t.co/7Ir3Fn937b

If the basket is not fully collateralized, it's time to trade 📈 https://t.co/UE5rWmYVHL

9/ Step 2: Determine Trade 🔎

The BM first determines what its current holdings are worth, and  the value of assets it needs based on the new basket from ☝️

If there is DISABLED collateral remaining in the BM, it is marked for trade for the new healthy collateral https://t.co/7jKwUDvsDl

10/ Step 3: Sell Old Collateral

Through the trading module, the DISABLED collateral is exchanged for healthy collateral

Steps 2 &amp; 3 are repeated until no DISABLED collateral remains

Naturally, because the BM is trading out of an unhealthy position, there may be a shortfall https://t.co/lzOLKy060f

11/ Step 4: Sell RSR

If a shortfall exists, RSR is sold to collateralize the basket to 100% 🤩

If there is not enough RSR to make up the deficit, a haircut is applied to RToken holders

In both scenarios, re-collateralization concludes and normal RToken operations resume 🟢 https://t.co/Fws29vJZRD

12/ Autonomous Re-collateralization Accomplished ✅

This demonstrates the elegance of what went on under the hood during eUSD's self-healing process. Free from external influence, eUSD has overcome this trial and emerges stronger 💪

And so much more is possible with RTokens 💫
