1/ It's been a wild couple weeks amidst the banking turmoil and USDC depeg

We also bore witness to the incredible self-healing process of eUSD allowing it to regain peg under its own power

Today, the process concludes and eUSD becomes fully collateralized again. Here's howüëá https://t.co/8glm8yLBxr

2/ In the process of swapping to emergency USDT collateral, a circuit breaker protecting against bad trades triggered, and the re-collateralization process was paused before RSR could be sold, leaving eUSD 97% backed

3/ The governance proposal to re-enable the trading module has successfully executed. Thank you to the RSR stakers whose governance participation made this possible

The RSR auction has also been executed, thus fully re-collateralizing eUSD

Normal eUSD functions have resumed üü¢

4/ What does the RSR auction entail?

RSR from the staked RSR (eusdRSR) is auctioned off to buy USDT (the undercollateralized piece of basket) until the backing of eUSD is 100%

This shortfall came as a result of selling de-pegged USDC and DAI collateral (at the time) for USDT

5/ eUSD has demonstrated that stablecoins CAN remain stable in the midst of turbulence - endless opportunities await in the RTokens that anyone can create

6/ We would like to again express our gratitude to the RSR stakers who played a vital role in eUSD's self-healing process üôè

This POAP commemorates the heroic efforts of RSR holders defending eUSD's peg

(only current eusdRSR holders can claim)
