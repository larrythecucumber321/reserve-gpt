We think we've built something the world truly needs and enjoyed coming together IRL to explore what comes next... 👌

And in a world partly re-organized around remote working, it's a reminder of the importance of being in person sometimes. https://t.co/yJj7RYUDre

Taylor is mapping out a unique RToken idea in the above picture, but at some point on Tuesday one of the boards looked like this...

As these entries take focus, we'll be sharing them here and in depth on Discord 👉 https://t.co/KrC9PKiz0R https://t.co/2EvDGON0Qd

Wednesday, Part 1: Hackathon

Wait for the fruit to bloom on this one, as it's led to some developments that will come into reality pretty soon 🔥

Seamlessly organized by @larrythecumber, and special thanks to @0xJMG for bringing the exact right people into the room 🤝 https://t.co/aPUmpLJSUF https://t.co/pPorvjmPNR

Wednesday Part 2: We joined @fraxfinance, @FlywheelDeFi, and @reflexerfinance for a night of #ETHDenver decompression with fellow stablecoin maxis!

With some similar aims across our projects, getting to see our communities mix, cross-pollinate ideas and chill was 🔥 https://t.co/u9cC1fFqfV

Stay warm Denver! In the first few days of #EthDenver2023, we handed out hundreds of beanies🔥

All around the city, you saw them - on the streets, on Uber drivers, at the conference...

(Almost) all were given to people who shared the values and appreciated the mission. https://t.co/ocPR9JoEmP

Thursday, the team hit #EthDenver2023 fully, not least to see @0xJMG speaking with @jackchong_jc on how and why asset backed currency is taking shape as one of the strengths crypto can offer the world.

Speaking of which... 👉 https://t.co/qyPRdIrEIJ

Things to mention...

- We don't speak much about governance (yet), but there's a whole other arm of Reserve working on this millennia-old problem

- The fantastic Curve ecosystem folks holding a livestream Llama Party with @mattimost https://t.co/FX5Yfms1VC

And not to forget...

- @taylo_r_ casually blowing our minds with an unconsidered RToken...

- Everyone seems to know @Naan_Fungible!

- @larrythecumber's secret personal superpower is "play any sport at pro level"

So far we have...

built massive pathways in Latin America,
designed the protocol,
evolved it into a platform,
set it free after the fifth audit,
and seen the first RToken launched.

The year is young with more to come...
