🦺 As mentioned last Friday, welcome to Reserve's safety week! 🦺

Over the next five days, the protocol will be sharing how it has worked tirelessly to pursue and exceed industry-standard safety practices.

Today's installment lays the groundwork for the rest of the week!

This piece will cover why safety is so important to both Reserve and RToken users, and then outlines what the rest of the week will cover.

Without further ado, dig in https://t.co/pKFw2stl2l

🦺 Tomorrow will cover how Reserve mitigates smart contract risk. See you there! 🦺

In addition, RToken Lab will be held this week and will discuss safety heavily, as well as a few other growth topics.
