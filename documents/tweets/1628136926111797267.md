2/5 This event celebrates our All-Clear milestone (Reserve passing all code audits) 🥳 

Now we want YOU, the buidler, to show off what Reserve's asset-backed currencies (RTokens) can do.

We have 2 hackathon categories:
1️⃣ RToken pitch &amp; adoption
2️⃣ Collateral plugin development

3/5

1️⃣ will have two subcategories:

⚾️ Pitch: participants create a deck and present on an RToken basket composition, revenue sharing, and growth strategy.

👶 Adoption: prizes for adoption of YOUR deployed RToken

4/5

2️⃣ The Collateral plugin development category invites hackers to build RToken plugins for your favorite protocol 

This expands the limits of what assets are usable in RToken baskets. Want to use @MorphoLabs or @StargateFinance collateral? Help make it happen!

5/5 Apply to attend here for an exciting day of ideation, creation, and deployment! https://t.co/I0TFTBwccW
