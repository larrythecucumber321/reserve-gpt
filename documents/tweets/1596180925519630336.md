3/16 For our Grand Prize,
@0xLycurguz
and
@lylethedev
are 2 of the 7 participants working on different but intriguing projects for the $100,000 Stablecoin Defi Innovation Bounties💥

Judging in early January! 😎

4/16 @coffiasse and @ithihasR33DY are working to make @Uniswap V2 and V3 LP positions available as collateral.

What Uni pools will you use to back an RToken?

5/16 A big shout out to @dxganta, who is building a host of collateral options including @LidoFinance, @MapleFinance and @BadgerDAO plugins!

Thank you for bringing multiple new collaterals to the platform 💥

6/16 @FraxFinance - Fraxswap (fiat and non-fiat pairs) and Fraxlend (USD-pegged stablecoins) positions would make for some interesting collateral options, thank you @shr1ftyy for the work you're putting in!

We're curious what will come from these FRAX money building blocks...

7/16 Corporate credit protocols like @ClearpoolFin and @goldfinch_fi will offer a unique way to back RTokens with real world assets, a big shout out to @larrythecucumber for tackling those!

8/16 A thank you to @orpheuslummis, who is building a plugin to enable derivatives positions on @dYdX to be used as underlying collateral!

9/16 @Jaylon\_\_Li and @ZanZ3ndegiAzadi are building plugins for liquid staking positions including @Coinbase $cbETH and @Rocket_Pool $rETH to be used as collateral for RTokens - allowing backing an RToken with layer 1 consensus participation 💥

10/16 @pyrodna is working on creating plugins for nToken positions on @NotionalFinance, bringing a fixed borrowing &amp; lending protocol onto the platform.

11/16 @gautam_sabhahit is looking to create @ConvexFinance collateral plugins for the Reserve ecosystem!

12/16 Finally, we want to give a big thank you to those who are working on the Research and Content bounty, we’re excited to see what you guys come up with! 👏👏👏👏

14/16 Lastly, a quick reminder that there is still plenty of time for builders to join, form a team &amp; submit a project! We have $250k up for grabs, if you’re interested, join here!

Grand Prize: https://t.co/AoXRLRXucV

Registration: https://t.co/oJLF967THp

15/16 Because of the work of everyone here, we may be on the path to 40+ collateral assets for any particular RToken by the New Year.

That's a very healthy selection for deployers, as we pursue the path to stable currency for everyone 🔥

Thank you for building with us ♥️

16/16 ...And if you want to know more, or pick the brains of our team, join @nnevvinn and @mattimost for an AMA next Tuesday at 12pm PST 🔥
