1) Rangers, MEV searchers, &amp; arb aficionados...

Tomorrow, we call on all of you to participate in the first auction of defaulted collateral that backs $eUSD, an asset-backed currency deployed on our protocol!

Auctions available to begin at 3:37am PST ‚è∞ https://t.co/AAki5KrnHs

2) When $eUSD was launched two weeks ago, I doubt many people in the world were expecting $USDC to depeg from $1, but it has, and here were are.

$eUSD is backed with 25% $cUSDC and 25% $saUSDC which have remained below their default thresholds of $0.9875 for 24hrs. https://t.co/PBXWxETyWZ

3) The cUSDC + saUSDC portions of the basket officially changed to `DEFAULTED` at 9:37pm PST this evening https://t.co/qTzE8HKwJq

4) After the 6hr trading delay (defined by governance) at ~3:37am PST, anyone will be able to trigger the auctions on https://t.co/XnuGIPj2Op or via Etherscan and they will last for 15 minutes with a max slippage from the oracle price of 1%. https://t.co/nFW3uPzsOu

5) To trigger the auctions in https://t.co/XnuGIPj2Op, go to the link below and click the "Run all auctions" button.

Note 1: This button is expensive because it runs through variety of calls to trigger anything available

Note 2: See the [RARE] note in copy. So soon! üòÖ https://t.co/4OyTALgzMt

6) To trigger the auctions in Etherscan, head to the Backing Manager contract and write an empty array `[]` to  manageTokens function, which will trigger the auction specifically and more gas efficiently

7) There will be 3 auctions tomorrow! (amounts using current chainlink oracle price)

1st: ~ $250,469 of $cUSDC for $USDT
2nd: ~$250,469 of $saUSDC for $USDT
3rd: staked $RSR for $USDT to bring the total backing to 100%

8) The auctions will all be conducted with $USDT because the protocol has already determined that the remaining two USD backup collaterals ($USDC &amp; $DAI) have defaulted, and so has replaced $saUSDC &amp; $cUSDC with $USDT. https://t.co/nwwmwdj0jJ

9) To participate in auctions, go to the Auctions tab for $eUSD on https://t.co/bLNJVfGdyw and navigate to the Gnosis Auction link that will generate here.

10) Gnosis Auction uses batch auctions, which are a popular mechanism for ensuring fair price for both the decentralized and traditional finance worlds. Batch auctions enable matching of limit orders of buyers and sellers with the same clearing price for all participants. https://t.co/rt7hMZl5DQ

11) Each auction will last 15 minutes and anyone (anyone!) is able to participate. If you see a deal you would like to take advantage of, please feel free to involve yourself!

12) The protocol needs to obtain more $USDT in order for $eUSD to be fully collateralized and for the backing to return to 100%. It is designed to rely on decentralized free market auctions to get there.

13) When this is all done and auctions have completed successfully it will be the first time the protocol has undergone its autonomous operations to recollateralize a defaulted asset backed currency with staked $RSR!

14) Cheers to $eUSD holders who were hopefully able to sleep a bit more soundly this weekend knowing that staked $RSR overcollateralization had their backs even as anxiety flew around the rest of the stablecoin world ü•Ç
