Let's begin with @DeFi_Made_Here's submission.

This submission is exemplary due to how clear the thread is, with simple, informative diagrams utilized. This contribution covered topics like overcollateralization and explains Reserve's liquidity strategy.

Next up is @SchizoXBT's piece on Reserve, which covers how users can generate yield using Reserve and what staking and governance opportunities $RSR holders may choose. This was a 3 part series!

.@0xCliffBooth made a straightforward primer on the benefits of diversification, clearly citing both how TradFi has immensely benefited from it as well as its implications to optimize things like staking yield for $ETH+ holders.

On the topic of ETH+, @DeFiVaults made an excellent overview as to how this RToken could have mitigated the June 2022 stETH depeg crisis. This also explains the diversification benefit of RTokens in a simple manner.

Following this is none other than @0xTomSawyer of $hyUSD.

This slightly more longform piece shows the potential of flatcoins and how they can be put to work in DeFi. This set the stage for him to introduce his favorite RToken, $hyUSD! https://t.co/R4nT6PZopX
