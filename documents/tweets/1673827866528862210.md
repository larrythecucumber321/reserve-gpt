Our $20M investment in the @CurveFinance ecoysystem opens up a lot more opportunities for RToken liquidity providers to stake

@ConvexFinance @yearnfi @StakeDAOHQ all provide boosted CRV farming for users

 In this thread, we explore the different staking options LPs have ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/B2cTypplW2

2/ Of course, @ConvexFinance is a classic choice, providing consistent yields with the largest veCRV holdings in DeFi

For eUSD specifically, you can additionally earn $FXS rewards by staking with @fraxfinance

3/ Another option is @yearnfi - their new factory vaults can be permissionlessly created for any Curve pool. CRV rewards from your LP are automatically compounded into your base asset

e.g. CRV rewards are sold to purchase and stake more hyUSD/eUSD LP

4/ Lastly, we have @StakeDAOHQ who provides the same autocompounding benefits that Yearn does. Just sit back and let them do the farming for you

5/ As an RToken LP, one of the main considerations is the boost multiplier you get with through each protocol, which determines the CRV APY

Let's compare hyUSD/eUSD's boosts, and their resultant APYs:

Convex: 2.38x -&gt; 20.81%
Yearn: 1.39x -&gt; 13.1%
StakeDAO: 2.34x -&gt; 19.25%

6/ The boost multipliers are not set in stone. They're a function of:

1) The veCRV lock the protocol has
2) The boost they apply to that particular pool
3) The total liquidity the protocol has in that pool

You may want to stay up to date on each protocol

7/ Of course, you could always stake on Curve itself, most advantageous if you have a large personal veCRV lock ðŸ”’

If you do, we're curious why you have read this far ðŸ˜…
