Title: 1708936422672265342

1/ September's community education rewards are in - well done to all the contributors!

This month saw everything from detailed research reports predicting RToken organizations to simple comparisons explaining how overcollateralization helps in countries without bank protections https://t.co/C4pp004PlO

2/ This month's leading light was @owanikin, who argued in a four-part series that RTokens make a strong case for parking DAO treasuries into.

This first installment was especially data driven and eloquent, something  that aids the educational value immensely. https://t.co/CT6gVLKfVO

3/ The remaining 3 parts can be found below. Ifeoluwa argues that reputable stablecoins will repeatedly depeg and RToken overcollateralization presents a viable solution.

He draws upon lots of existing Reserve contet in his argument therefore is very well researched! https://t.co/wFcHw35bhA

4/ Another highlight of the month was @IndexDollar deployer Dee's long post titled "Yields and Shields".

If you've wondered how RToken overcollateralization compares to traditional banking infrastructure, this is one for you (hint: in New Zealand there is no FDIC equivalent). https://t.co/jYMxnSsszH

5/ Next up is @stakedqueen's exploration of the current stablecoin landscape, and where RTokens fit in.

There's even a brief look at de-dollarization, something perhaps forgotten by today's DeFi landscape. Perhaps a nonUSD RToken could be on the horizon? https://t.co/f5U5gecE6W

6/ @Franklin_DAO's deep dive into Reserve makes some of the more complicated aspects of the protocol accessible, such as walking readers through the recapitalization process.

It also offers interesting predictions for the future, like entire RToken maintenance organizations... https://t.co/Sj2sWN7gkg

7/ @ReserveWeekly's roundup of Reserve Live with Nevin late last month also gets a reward.

This recap of the event codifies some of the conversations being had about @bffcalifornia strategy and how Reserve's new brand reconceptualizes the protocol. https://t.co/VdL2sNsQUd

8/ Next under the spotlight is @fennecstuff's image-heavy look at @HighYieldUSD.

This is the start of a striking visual series called "EarnWith", and it focuses on graphical explanations of RToken basics like collateral plugins, revenue splits and deployers. https://t.co/Zs9ay2ZzRl

9/ A regular winner is @SotoPerregil. His piece this month is a video explaining how Reserve mitigates inflation through yield-bearing collateral and then explains $eUSD's collateral depeg resistance.

As always, Reserve is especially perceptive to video content! https://t.co/CjxmVmHpaD

10/ We also have @melojuanS4URUS's video covering the recently released safety series. It overviews the 5 different sections in a novel and exciting way to educate!

This topic is extremely important to Reserve contributors, so experimentation here is most welcome. https://t.co/vlqeVQBc5N

11/ Finally, we'd like to highlight the consistent roundups from @SMallinson - a true pillar of Reserve's community. While they occur every week (follow him!), this roundup was a particular highlight.

This is as fresh as it gets for staying up to date with Reserve! https://t.co/gIshAkUIr3

12/ Few keep their eyes on the prize in the same way as @SMallinson. Fewer still are making calls substantiated with evidence like github repository updates as well as calculations for RToken deployer profit margins.

His work really is a consistent Reserve one-stop-shop. https://t.co/JMBgH7CvxO

13/ That is all of this month! If you'd like context for this program, read here: https://t.co/q06XLbIDm6
