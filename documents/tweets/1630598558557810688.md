On 02/24, the Electronic Dollar (eUSD), a decentralized 1:1 asset-backed stablecoin built with @reserveprotocol, officially launched on the Ethereum &amp; MobileCoin blockchains.

eUSD is NOT your average stablecoin. It is decentralized, community-governed, and censorship-resistant. https://t.co/BzlzdscXZ7

The collateral composition of eUSD consists of a diversified basket of yield-bearing, trusted stablecoin derivatives using Compound and Aave (cUSDC, cUSDT, aUSDC, aUSDT).

Not only does this basket provide a censorship resistant, stable backing - it also generates yield üëÄ

100% of the yield that eUSD generates is directed to RSR stakers who participate in governance and provide overcollateralization.

Fun fact: eUSD is currently 189% overcollateralized, 89% of which is coming from RSR stakers earning ~3% APY.

eUSD is launched on both the Ethereum and MobileCoin blockchains, where it has its specific use cases ‚¨áÔ∏è

On MobileCoin, it enables borderless, private-payments at sub-penny fees with end-to-end zero-knowledge encryption, self custody, and regulatory compliance.

On Ethereum, eUSD is a censorship-resistant stablecoin for various DeFi participants.

By leveraging Reserve's top 10 CVX voting power, yield farmers and DAO treasuries alike can earn high yield on decentralized, censorship-resistant, stable holdings.

While all eUSD will be minted on Ethereum, the portion that's required on MobileCoin will be bridged over using a custom bridge.

Security of this bridge is of crucial importance, which is why only KYC'd and approved liquidity provider institutions will be able to use it to LP.

Just as the 1:1 asset backed stablecoins built on Reserve ("RTokens") provide 24/7 proof of reserve's on-chain, so does the eUSD bridge show full transparency.

The eUSD bridge auditor will always show exactly what eUSD on MobileCoin is backed by: https://t.co/LrQrXTsm5a
