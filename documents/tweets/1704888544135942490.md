2/ This release offers:

💹 Enhanced trading experience with Dutch Auctions
🔒 Additional security safeguards
💻 Quality-of-life improvements for developers with richer data sources, and granular control

3/ Streamlined trades w/ Dutch Auctions 🏎️💨

Say goodbye to the uncertainties of batch auctions! Dutch auctions start with a high price that lowers incrementally until a satisfactory bid is placed, making the auction process more predictable and inclusive https://t.co/vpQ88geoL0

4/ Dutch auction bidders compete off-chain in mempools 🌐

This innovation plugs RToken auctions into MEV machinery by allowing protocol auctions to be atomically settled with flash loans once profitable

This is a win for RToken holders who get better trade execution

5/ The development team extends thanks to the @code4rena team and participating auditors for their thorough audit of the 3.0.0 codebase
