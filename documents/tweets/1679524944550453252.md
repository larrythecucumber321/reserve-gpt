We are overjoyed to share BlueChip, the independent nonprofit organization dedicated to evaluating stablecoins at no cost to the public.

@bluechip_org aims to provide unbiased ratings which help understand which stablecoins are safer to use.

For Reserve and its ecosystem, this public good will provide invaluable insight as to which assets are suitable to back RTokens. The protocol is extremely grateful.

We are so enthused by this because it guards against poorly designed stablecoins and provides much needed context.

The team will analyze stablecoins using the SMIDGE framework which evaluates stability, management, implementation, decentralization, governance and externals.

More on SMIDGE can be found at https://t.co/sJ5h8I2GHs

BlueChip will be staffed by @levitben (CEO), @GarettJones (Chief Economist) and @Deathereum (director of ratings).

Reserve founder @nnevvinn, along with @RuneKek and many others donated to make this public good a reality.
