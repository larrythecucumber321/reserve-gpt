We are excited to announce new ETH Liquid Staked Derivative (LSD) plugins

We offer plugins for both @LidoFinance and @Rocket_Pool, with more on the horizon

With Ethereum's Shapella upgrade around the corner, it's a fantastic time to explore the potential of ETH LSDs 🧵👇 https://t.co/JMQ57vUx5Y

📚 Quick primer on ETH LSDs:

To run a node and validate Ethereum transactions, you need to stake 32 ETH. LSD protocols enable users with limited resources to join forces, secure the network, and earn staking rewards by pooling their assets together

LSD-backed RTokens offer key advantages:

 ፨ Enhances Ethereum network's decentralization

👥 Diversifies risks associated with single protocols

🧪 Promotes competition &amp; innovation

🧷 RSR overcollateralization acts as a safety net in case of protocol issues

💡 Decentralization is paramount

LSD-based RTokens address concerns raised by @ethereum about staker composition &amp; the dominance of specific LSD protocols

⚖️ When an LSD protocol exceeds consensus thresholds (eg 1/2), coordinated activity could lead to cartelization &amp; centralization of block space, as they would gain the power to censor or extract value from the Ethereum protocol

Supporting diverse LSDs is what RTokens enable 🤝 https://t.co/1NmzN7WdVU

🌱 Yield opportunities!

Users can enjoy attractive returns on their ETH. Plus, the new LSD plugins are composable, allowing for the creation of unique asset-backed RTokens, including LSD ETH and other assets https://t.co/jroFEbHuaR
