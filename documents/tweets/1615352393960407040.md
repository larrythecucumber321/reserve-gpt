1/22

99 days since the protocol launch, and we are delighted to share the results of our Reserve x Gitcoin Hackathon 🚀 

- 24 collaterals being added to the protocol to serve as backing for RTokens (bringing us to 42)
- 2 projects ready to be incubated
- Nine content winners

2/22 First up, our Innovation in DeFi awards, two projects receiving $15,000 each, projects we feel have a high chance of success in establishing RTokens in the world 🌎

Auto-adjusting RTokens, and minting RTokens without chasing collateral sources - both knockout features 🔥

3/22 WINNER 1: “Dynarev” Stablecoin Rating Framework by @Lavi_54 and @dabar_90

Dynarev (”Dynamic Review”) is a framework for dynamic risk ratings for stablecoins and DeFi protocols, with a goal of allowing RTokens to have auto-adjusted collateral baskets based on risk scores.

4/22 WINNER 2: Reserve Zaps by @larrythecumber 

Zaps make it easy for users to mint RTokens without needing to obtain all the various collateral tokens.

Instead you can use a single token like USDC, ETH, DAI, obtain the collateral and mint the RToken in a single transaction.

5/22 Next up, 24 collateral assets or protocols are going to land on the Reserve platform, thanks to the winning work of 15 coders 💥 

Welcome to the protocols and assets that will be available as collateral for asset-backed currencies 🔥 https://t.co/1N376TmI3n

6/22 Congratulations to all our winners!

8/22 As we prepare to enter the “open for RTokens” phase, education and information about the protocol begins to play a key role.

So, a big thank you to all entrants for the content bounty prize!

Nine winners coming up!

17/22 How to Increase the Adoption of Reserve Protocol by ltodd22
https://t.co/wJ08rndFRR

Prize: $500

“A brief for the team in many ways! Like ‘a tree falling in a forest…’ the most elegant protocol only serves its purpose if people know about it, understand it, and use it"

18/22 There we have it… for today! We’d like to add a few last things.

This isn’t the end of the process. We’ve been introduced to some wonderful engineers, some great writers, and some deep thinkers, and this first Hackathon has inspired ideas for later in the year.

19/22 To the Ethereum community and the Reserve community, stay in touch with us and help us bring fully-backed, governed, protected stable money into the world — Discord https://t.co/IjXwLtp7rz is the best place to find the team.

20/22 Thank you to everyone who entered - every submission means a lot to us, and we will be in touch individually with many of you.
