The Code4rena audit marks Reserve's 5th audit, providing us the confidence to make the ALL CLEAR announcement and inviting anyone to create yield-bearing, asset-backed currencies on Reserve 🚀 https://t.co/XRarm8REu6

What sets @code4rena audits apart? It's a whole community of Wardens who each audit the codebase &amp; report bugs they find, not just a single firm/auditor

Judges assess findings for severity, validity &amp; quality 🧐

We welcome our new friends to join our community, learn more about the world of asset-backed currencies, and to share your unique security insights with us 🤝
