Now that Reserve Protocol has moved to All Clear, and there is the first live RToken, $eUSD, here is a quick step-by-step on staking $RSR üëâ

Step 1: Visit https://t.co/mp36FtymOU, the first dapp for Reserve Protocol üî• https://t.co/qjKrlX6rkC

Connect your wallet, via the Power button at the top right.

This gives you three options to connect your wallet, including WalletConnect, which offers access to many major wallets. https://t.co/yAUdDMtd4Y

3/12 

Depending on your wallet, you will be asked to grant permission to Register to connect: https://t.co/0YoPwdY7ME

4/12 

Now you are hooked up, it's time to explore Register and the available staking RTokens, which right now is eUSD.

You know you are connected to Register via the green icon on the top right: https://t.co/tt7tvESfox

On the $eUSD screen, click on Stake + Unstake (left = desktop, right = mobile) https://t.co/Elv5YRXPN2

Here is your place to decide how much RSR you wish to stake, where you help overcollateralize eUSD in return for a portion of yield the token accumulates ‚úÖ

(This is also where you find the Unstake button, currently grayed out) https://t.co/BYwsbZHPlH

Gas fee time! You will now confirm two transactions:

1.  To allow the use of your RSR

2.  To begin staking your RSR

In these examples, the gas comes to around ~$20, which is a reasonable benchmark to expect, but is variable depending on Ethereum gas fees at the time. https://t.co/199YhqEFUP

...And there you go!

After the first time or two, it takes less than a couple of minutes to choose your staking positions üî•

But before you leave, a few notes from the team, and a deeper article into staking üëâ https://t.co/miqjNMcfTJ

‚ö†Ô∏è You‚Äôre playing an active role in the safety of RTokens, and your money is important.

Use judgement to decide your confidence in the baskets that underpin an RToken, and your risk tolerances in terms of receiving yield, versus the likelihood of asset defaults ‚ö†Ô∏è

RSR's purpose in life is to govern and overcollateralize RTokens.

RSR stakers are "first loss capital", which we suggest will lead to careful stewarding of already fully-backed RTokens as the years roll by.

It's in everyone's interest to keep baskets secure!

11/12 

The first RToken, eUSD, offers 100% yield to stakers.

Over the coming months and years, we expect to see many new RTokens, with various baskets, with different markets or use-cases, and offering different yield percentages.

Let's explore stable currency together!
