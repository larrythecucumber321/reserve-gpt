Overall RToken market cap has experienced consistent growth since the Reserve platform was launched.

- eUSD currently leads with a $13.2M market cap 
- ETH+ and hyUSD both have around $0.5 market cap https://t.co/aDn6LEZTrM

The amount of RSR that has been staked over time follows a similar pattern. Currently, 1.45% of the total RSR supply has been staked! https://t.co/LD6WHFFLmA

The vast majority of circulating eUSD (90%) is being productively deployed on @CurveFinance - currently earning up to 21% APY by staking the LP token on @ConvexFinance. https://t.co/TuvxKmKnXi
