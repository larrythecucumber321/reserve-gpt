Get up to speed on the latest RToken farming options with this week's yield update https://t.co/Zm02Qym0BW

To begin, none of the RToken Curve pools were impacted by the Curve exploit yesterday.

The vulnerability was specific to Vyper compiler versions 0.2.15-0.3.0, while RToken pools all use version 0.3.1. https://t.co/xvRRz420fR

In other news, ETH+ continued to grow as farmers take advantage of up to 35%+ APY on Yearn. https://t.co/WJe9lFpAK9

Unfortunately, since the hack, Curve has lost ~50% of deposits. Due to this, eUSD and hyUSD saw outflows as liquidity providers reduced exposure to Curve. https://t.co/pOwu06LCRQ

Lastly, RSR stakers are using https://t.co/mp36FtymOU to earn double digit yields by staking on the RToken of their choice.

That's all for this weeks RToken yield update! To discuss this and more, please hop into the Discord at https://t.co/LmdKuMvzok. https://t.co/89nviIFiiA
