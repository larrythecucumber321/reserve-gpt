Introducing RToken #3 built on the Reserve Protocol: High Yield USD (hyUSD) ðŸ‘‹

hyUSD is a tokenized high yield savings product that provides convenient access to DeFi yields, helping holders grow and preserve their wealth over time. https://t.co/NqDNRw1Fhq

With an estimated yield of 8%, hyUSD outpaces the rate of inflation in over 100 countries around the world, providing a refuge for purchasing power.

As with all asset-backed currencies issued on the Reserve protocol, hyUSD provides auditable proof of reserves on-chain 24/7.

So where does the yield come from?

The collateral backing for hyUSD provides exposure to fiat stablecoins and US Treasuries through @ConvexFinance and @FluxDeFi yield-bearing assets.

13.5% fUSDC - Flux USDC
13.5% fDAI - Flux DAI
36.5% Convex MIM+3CRV
36.5% Convex eUSD+FRAXBP https://t.co/wu5m5DzDf3

These assets were backtested for stability and selected for the following traits:

1) being sufficiently decentralized

2) striking a balance between risk and reward

The ongoing process of basket management will be done through governance proposals enacted by RSR stakers

With the current yield profile, the on-chain revenue split aims to balance a competitive return for holders and meaningful incentives to stakers for overcollateralization and governance

81% to hyUSD holders

16% to RSR stakers

3% to hyUSD treasury

hyUSD utilizes Reserve Protocol's novel overcollateralization mechanism, where RSR stakers are the first loss capital in the case of failing collateral.

The mechanism was battle tested during the run on Silicon Valley Bank on March 9th:

Boosting security through overcollateralization is just one facet of Reserveâ€™s commitment to safety. With 5 comprehensive audits, including the latest by @code4rena, and a substantial $5m bug bounty program via @immunefi, Reserve continues to fortify the protocol https://t.co/QU57AecFfq
