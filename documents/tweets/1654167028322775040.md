Weâ€™re thrilled to announce the 2nd RToken built on the Reserve Protocol: ETH+

ETH+ is a community-governed, diversified, yield-bearing staked Ethereum index with overcollateralization protection. https://t.co/LcZFN4St2W

The LSD ecosystem can be daunting for casual crypto users, and will only get more challenging to navigate as more LSD protocols come online.

ETH+ aims to be the easiest way to get passive yield exposure to a diversified basket of ETH LSDs

What makes ETH+ special? A safety-first approach

In addition to diversification, ETH+ utilizes Reserve Protocol's novel overcollateralization mechanism, where RSR stakers are the first loss capital in the case of failing collateral

Furthermore, following 5 comprehensive smart contract audits, the Reserve Protocol recently launched a new $5m bug bounty program with @immunefi.

We're excited to make this commitment to long-term safety ðŸ”’

ETH+ was deployed by @EridianAlpha. As a leader in the ETH staking community, Eridan is focused on promoting decentralization and accessibility through his involvement in existing and upcoming LSD protocols, as well as his work with the @ethStaker Knowledge Base.

The initial collateral backing for ETH+ includes
50% rETH - @Rocket_Pool
50% wstETH - @LidoFinance https://t.co/YX7Zk6fSJv

The collateral backing is meant to be updated whenever a new LSD is suitable to be integrated, through governance proposals enacted by RSR stakers. 

The criteria for which LSDs should be included will be decided by RSR stakers, informed by LSD enthusiasts like @EridianAlpha

95% of the staking yield will be passed to the RToken holders, while 5% will be distributed to the RSR stakers for providing governance and over-collateralization. 

This ratio was chosen to be competitive in a growing LSD market, and can be adjusted through RSR staker governance
