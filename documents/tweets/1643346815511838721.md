1/ We're excited to announce the launch of @FluxDeFi collateral plugins 👏

fTokens can be used as collateral in Reserve's asset-backed stablecoins (RTokens)

This brings the risk-free Treasury rate to all DeFi participants

(Read to end for community AMA 🤝) https://t.co/JSHLjmNtDc

2/ @OndoFinance's novel OUSG let’s brings a key RWA on-chain, letting DeFi participants access the risk-free rate

However, access to OUSG may be gated by investor status...

Enter Flux Finance 🚪

3/ Flux Finance is a clever innovation which permissionlessly enables universal access to the risk-free Treasury rate by letting investors lend stablecoins to those who wish to lever up exposure to US Treasuries

i.e. supply OUSG -&gt; borrow USDC -&gt; buy more OUSG -&gt; repeat

4/ Lenders can supply USDC to get fUSDC in return, where lenders earn interest approaching the Treasury rate, thanks to the OUSG leveraging https://t.co/qoKj6aRhSc

5/ RTokens can be backed by these Flux assets and other high-yielding stablecoin positions create an attractive low-risk inflation busting dollar

An example plugin (fDAI) can be found here https://t.co/HkCb1d5BSk
