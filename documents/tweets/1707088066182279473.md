Title: 1707088066182279473

1/ How do RTokens preserve capital and grow wealth?

This diagram sets the stage as to how RTokens successfully do the above and restore 1:1 backing, even during a black swan. https://t.co/vY8NTB2dDo

2/ To explain how RTokens grow wealth, protect capital and act in emergencies, the diagram breaks down an RToken into its 4 constituent parts:

1️⃣ The RToken itself
2️⃣ Its collateral basket
3️⃣ RSR overcollateralization
4️⃣ Emergency collateral

3/ For the top layer of the diagram, or the RToken itself, this is the logo and mandate of the RToken.

See @HighYieldUSD's mandate as an example: "A decentralized flatcoin that provides convenient access to DeFi yields, enabling holders to earn passive income on their capital". https://t.co/77QxIIKSGM

4/Below that in the diagram is RToken collateral, represented by the logos of the assets backing the RToken.

This example includes the likes of @circle's $USDC and @Paxos $USDP. Different RTokens have different collateral, and this representation diagram reflects that.

5/ This collateral is usually yield bearing, and the RTokens can be exchanged for their underlying collateral.

This yield bearing collateral is what grows wealth through RTokens.

For @ETHPlus_, the yield bearing collateral is @LidoFinance's wstETH and @rocket_pool's rETH.

6/ These assets earn yield from ETH staking, and this yield is passed onto those holding the RToken.

This yield is paid out in ETH, meaning RToken holders grow their wealth.

This diagram section highlights which yield bearing collateral powers RToken holder wealth creation.

7/ This yield being generated is configurable and can be directed at stakers for an overcollateralization incentive, or passed to RToken holders but usually a combination of both.

This brings us to the 3rd layer in the diagram: $RSR overcollateralization.

8/ This part of this diagram covers how $RSR is staked onto an RToken to overcollateralize it in case of an underlying collateral depeg.

Once the RToken detects the collateral has depegged, it sells the staked $RSR for emergency collateral - more on that later.

9/ Read on about how $eUSD, an RToken, dealt with $USDC's depeg:

✅ How it recapitalized holders before $USDC did
✅ How stakers providing first loss capital have been made whole

This diagram section identifies the mechanism with which RTokens protect the wealth they create. https://t.co/cuBiCfJAEk

10/ Finally, the RToken's emergency collateral is outlined in the diagram. This is collateral the RToken will exchange the RToken-specific staked RSR for in the event of a depeg.

As an example, view $eUSD's emergency collateral below, taken from register. https://t.co/S7sXDwwPYf

11/ For more details on how $eUSD swapped its collateral to the emergency basket and subsequently recapitalized itself, read the blogpost in the appendix.

This diagram section highlights the assets that RTokens use to try to insulate the wealth they have created.

This concludes the first installment of the diagram series. In the coming weeks we'll cover different diagrams to help familiarize you with the new art and diagram style.
