We're constantly reminded that the security of DeFi funds cannot be taken for granted üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

RToken overcollateralization luckily provides comfort

A recent revelation about @LidoFinance validator keys exposes stETH holders to loss

But ETH+ holders are defended against this üëá https://t.co/IoZskNhdcP

Lido has 9.25M ETH deposits, of which 320,000 could have been vulnerable due to the above

This loss amounts to a 3.5% drop in the value of stETH, wiping out nearly a year's worth of validator rewards

ETH+ already mitigates this by 1/2 thanks to being diversified between LSTs https://t.co/FlfJv1jxG9

However, the hypothetical loss to ETH+ holders is FULLY mitigated by its $RSR overcollateralization, totalling $107k of its $4.3M market cap

Even after selling $75k RSR to recapitalize from stETH losses and defend ETH+'s peg, there is still RSR remaining for another rainy day üå¶ https://t.co/fJsHNiOwcl
