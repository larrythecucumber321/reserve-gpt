Lots of stakers, lots of yield options and lots of CRV - that's the story in this week's RToken yield update ⬇️ https://t.co/JdG3sebazP

Last week, Reserve joined members of the Defi community in purchasing 2.5M CRV OTC.

The allocation comes from the previously announced $20M investment, and Reserve is thrilled to be standing shoulder to shoulder with @CurveFinance as they continue to lead stableswap innovation. https://t.co/VCdzKTNxel

While TVL was flat this week, https://t.co/mp36FtymOU continues to see consistent inflows from RSR stakers.

eUSD is the most popular staking option, with hyUSD and ETH+ slowly gaining traction. At the time of writing, all staking opportunities offer double digit yield on RSR. https://t.co/pjiQRcuvWs

RToken farmers continue to enjoy double digit yields by staking their LP tokens on @ConvexFinance and @yearnfi.

At over 15% on the eUSD and hyUSD pools, and up to 20% on the ETH+, RTokens offer options for stablecoin and ETH farmers of all shapes and sizes. https://t.co/v4VC0L7ibU

That's all for this week's RToken yield update!
