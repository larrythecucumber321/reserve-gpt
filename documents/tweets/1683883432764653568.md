That's a wrap! As some of you know, Reserve contributors spent last week in Paris coworking and attending @EthCC.

To kick it off, the protocol team all met (some for the first time) at @stable_summit, where @taylo_r_ laid down the law about the nature of money. https://t.co/fNQiwK1Bqf

Reserve co-creator @nnevvinn also presented at StableSummit, this time on a panel with @NuonFinance, @sidshekhar24 and @TheISCTeam.

This was a fantastic event with an incredibly high density of stablecoin afficionados - a big thanks to @CurveFinance for making it happen! https://t.co/ARtElHjFSa

After that summit, the team coworked to discuss and present all manner of topics.

A particular highlight was @pmckelvy1's talk about all the steps the protocol has and will continue to take to maximize security. https://t.co/Nt7vU1qkrF

ETH CC really delivered on the side events: @MorphoLabs's Future of France and @StakeDAOHQ's @La_Degen were a special experience.

Reserve also hosted its own event: a sound bath organized by @0xJMG. This chance to relax during such a busy week was much needed! https://t.co/8vp7ashnJX

This whirlwind visit was rounded off with a Reserve TVL growth hackathon, in which some novel designs were dreamt up.

All in all, protocol contributors had an extremely productive time and made some great connections with old friends and new. https://t.co/PtaCuM21H9

This next quarter is going to an exciting one for Reserve: collateral plugin updates, new audits, more Curve voting, improvements to the protocol itself and a heavy focus on governance!
