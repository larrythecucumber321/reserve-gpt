The top piece of educational content produced by the community this month should come as a surprise to no one: @SMallinson's faithful  roundup newsletters. https://t.co/HBd9KINo8a

3/

The attention paid to details is consistently unrivaled, such as explaining the backstory behind one of the most stylish flatcoins out there: @MaatFlatcoin. Go and read it above!

It's little wonder @SMallinson was recognized for Community Education Rewards previously üëèüëèüëè https://t.co/juPe0dcPgx

Up next is Mr K, a regular contributor to Community Education Rewards. His piece explains a revamped RToken function: auctions.

This piece's value lies in its simple approach to a complex yet critical topic!

Wondering how RToken revenue gets delivered? Read on! https://t.co/OYLA9NQw06

Coming in with a concised, annotated explainer on Base yield opportunities is @HighYieldUSD, run by the deployers of the eponymous RToken.

It's possible that this post helped get RToken TVL to all time highs this week üëÄ https://t.co/eiFJEzNt6R

Following that is the latest in the @HouseofChimera's series on Reserve.

They've been consistently bringing excellent content, and this post is their latest.

It does a great job at conveying RToken value propositions in a visual way, ensuring maximized knowledge transfer. https://t.co/WOvGac7L6f

These last two winners might be a touch less serious but they are no less valuable!

@ReserveMemes, a community run meme account, makes and highlights educational content produced in the Reserve ecosystem.

Give them a follow to be both entertained and educated! https://t.co/D6CjTFJsVg

Our second (and favorite) meme for this month is by Reserve community stalwart @Flamingo_Mafia.

This meme is positive, addresses some RToken benefits and is just the right amount of silly!

Other Reserve meme makers should be taking close notes ü§î https://t.co/WPGXWRkozG

9/ That's all for this month's Community Education Rewards. Congratulations to all the winners!

December's challenge: make a meme explaining where RToken yield actually comes from.

Clear, concise and entertaining entries will be prioritized!

10/

December's deadline is on the 30th to really round off the year. The core team is excited to review submissions next year üéÑ
