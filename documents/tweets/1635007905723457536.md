Title: 1635007905723457536

1) This morning, $eUSD collateral was rebalanced. The $cUSDC and $saUSDC were auctioned off to be replaced with the emergency backup: $USDT. ðŸŽ‰ https://t.co/fyPevDyEJY

2) Because $USDC was trading at a discount (~$0.955), that leaves $eUSD about 98% backed with collateral in the basket.

The next step is for the protocol to sell staked RSR in order to cover that difference and bring the backing back to 100%.

3) Under normal operations, that would happen pretty much right away. However, the protocol detected a tiny discrepancy - about 1 millionth of a token less was sent back from the auction contract than it expected.

4) Since the protocol defaults to safety in all situations and is designed to halt trading if there is *any* discrepancy to avoid potential losses, governance will have to vote to re-enable trading.

5) Once 7 days is complete (full gov cycle), and the proposal passes, it will sell RSR to fill the 2% gap. ðŸŽ‰

6) This isn't a real risk or problem for $eUSD holders, since it is pretty much deterministic that the auction will end up happening and the gap will be filled. But it does mean that it won't be done for another 7 days, instead of already being done now.

7) Generally, this is a great example of the automatic safeguards that are woven throughout the protocol's operations. If there is a safe thing to check, pause, and let governance weigh in, the protocol does it. RTokens are designed to preserve value in the safest way possible.

8) As an $RSR staker on $eUSD, if you choose to participate in the governance vote: first, delegate yourself your voting power and second, vote on https://t.co/mp36FtymOU!

9) To delegate yourself voting power, navigate to the Governance tab in https://t.co/XnuGIPjADX and click "delegate", approving the transaction before 10:23am PST on Tuesday March 14th

11) Until $RSR is sold to fully recollateralize $eUSD next weekend, please note that any redemptions will only return $0.98 for every $eUSD, which is still possible for any $eUSD holders if they would prefer liquidity now.

12) This was an exciting day for $eUSD holders and an exciting day for decentralized, stable, asset-backed currencies! ðŸŽ‰
