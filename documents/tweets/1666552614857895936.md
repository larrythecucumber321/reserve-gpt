Another eUSD revenue auction in the books ‚úÖ

There have been big upgrades to auctions on Register we are excited to share

Here's what running an $RSR auction looks like üé•üëá https://t.co/Z9wawJ05so https://t.co/cRsKUmwnKS

In the Auctions tab on Register, there's now a 'Check for auctions' button

You can now keep track of pending rewards for your favorite RTokens!

We see that collateral has appreciated for minting 13k more eUSD, so it's auction time ‚è∞

Once an auction is initiated, we switch gears to @GnosisDAO's nifty auction UI

Over the 15 minute auction, anyone can submit bids to trade their RSR for the eUSD revenue

When the auction ends, the winner can claim their eUSD whilst the protocol streams the received RSR as rewards to stakers

See the winner collect their 13k eUSD here:
