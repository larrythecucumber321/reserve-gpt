RTokens continue to show strength in choppy markets, and the yield options keep getting juicier for farmers. Let's dive in ⬇️ https://t.co/N9yl26YD7h

RToken TVL has been resilient - over the last couple of weeks Curve TVL has dropped around 30%, while RToken TVL is down just 10%.

ETH+ and hyUSD pools on Curve have actually grown during this time, further highlighting RToken strength https://t.co/rfjiRODm0j

For RToken farmers on @yearnfi and @ConvexFinance, things just keep getting better. LPs are earning up to 16% on eUSD, 27% on ETH+ and a whopping 42% on hyUSD

Lastly, despite a growing number of stakers, RSR real yields remain in the double digits. RTokens are not dividing the pie, they are growing it
