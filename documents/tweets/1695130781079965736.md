âœ… First revenue auctions for @HighYieldUSD

This marks the start of yield distribution to hyUSD holders

Notably, this is the FIRST time that any RToken revenue (and not RSR) has been processed - read on to learn about RToken melting ðŸ”¥ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/k98NXcrZYp

RTokens received from auction proceeds are sent to the Furnace, which is responsible for "melting" these new RTokens

Melting slowly burns the RTokens, which increases the exchange rate between RTokens and the underlying collateral basket (b/c less tokens entitled to collateral) https://t.co/afE8nAreNe

Here's a simple example:

- 1 RToken X is initially redeemable for 1 aUSDC at t_0

- Revenue auction happens for RToken X at t_1

- 1 RToken X is redeemable for 1.05 aUSDC at t_2 ... then 1.1 aUSDC at t_3 https://t.co/kEhhm7bHD8

Digging even further into the weeds, the rate of payouts exponentially decay, meaning that rewards are streamed faster at the beginning (similar to stRSR)

With hyUSD's parameters, the proceeds from any one auction will be distributed over the course of 2 months

Let's compare this to how RSR revenue is streamed over time, which results in staked RSR appreciating to RSR

The payout formula is actually shared between RTokens and RSR!

The difference is that RTokens are burned, making existing ones more valuable vs entitlement to more RSR https://t.co/lBt9XKnRiq
