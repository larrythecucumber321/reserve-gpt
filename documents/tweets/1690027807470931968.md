We are so back

1Ô∏è‚É£ eusdRSR = 1Ô∏è‚É£ RSR

The return of RSR staked on eUSD to a 1:1 ratio w/ RSR marks a significant milestone for Reserve (see the journey)

The resilience of RSR stakers helped turn lemons into self-healing money, and they've now been made whole for their efforts üëá https://t.co/45ZnDTN6gs

A brief refresher on eUSD's history ‚åõ

‚Ä¢ eUSD launched Feb 23
‚Ä¢ USDC depegged on Mar 11, eUSD autonomously switched to backup USDT collateral
‚Ä¢ USDC/DAI collateral was sold
‚Ä¢ RSR staked on eUSD is seized to cover the shortfall in collateral

Thanks to the seized RSR that was sold for various USDT-based collateral, eUSD was quickly recollateralized and has remained stable at $1 since (long before USDC)

No government rescue required, or hoping that tenuous insurance policies trigger - just DeFi working as it should https://t.co/Si4IGgqfJm

Reserve's appreciation for RSR stakers can't be understated

They suffered a loss defending eUSD's peg during the black swan, with the eusdRSR -&gt; RSR exchange rate dropping as low as 0.985

Now, 5 months later, RSR stakers rejoice as they continue to earn sweet APRs up to 19% üéâ https://t.co/IkFNhgJdwA
