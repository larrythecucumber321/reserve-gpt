@LidoFinance's increasing market share is on everyone's mind right now. While impressive, it arguably presents a threat to the overall health of the network.

Let's talk about ETH+ and how it could be used to mitigate these Ethereum staking centralization concerns.

2/

As a reminder, ETH+ is an RToken deployed using the Reserve protocol.

Its mandate includes maintaining an "Ethereum aligned Liquid Staking basket, making a positive impact to Ethereum's staking distribution and bringing value to ETH+ holders."

For more about ETH+, read on https://t.co/q85puGJ6aT

To quickly understand why Lido centralization is a concern, read this post from @evan_van_ness - a decentralization researcher.

This is a relatively complicated topic, so spend some time on it.

How does ETH+ fit into this debate? https://t.co/paUgIC00Vf

4/

ETH+ is equally backed by @LidoFinance's wstETH and @Rocket_Pool's rETH and these assets were chosen by @EridianAlpha with the community's help.

See https://t.co/pigMLpw7qC

This means the RToken is increasing Lido's market share, which as identified can be problematic. https://t.co/a3cxA3oyqD

5/

If half of the RToken's TVL is held with @LidoFinance, is it time for a collateral change?

After all, the RToken's mandate of "making a positive impact to Ethereum's staking distribution" is arguably not being met so long as the RToken remains backed by wstETH.

6/

Contributors have noticed this, and are currently in discussions to rebalance wstETH &amp; rETH to 33% and add @pendle_fi's @swellnetworkio LP positions.

This would increase yield and deepen network decentralization.

7/

Does this go far enough to protect decentralization?

According to @Rocket_Pool, @stakewise_io, @staderlabs and @divastaking, no.

In their eyes, no one solution should have more than 22% market share. https://t.co/0Vr8PJIZOc

8/

Under the proposed change, each liquid staking token would maintain a 33% share of ETH+.

While ETH+ is not exactly representative of the entire staking network, it would be mandate-compliant to respect the 22% figure outlined above.

9/

If RToken governors take this into account and consider switching ETH+ backing to reflect this sentiment, it may spur TVL growth from proponents of decentralization.

This would be set against a backdrop of increasing numbers of participants concerned by Lido dominance.

10/

As an example, ETH+ backing could contain 22% max of each staking token from each solution committed to the 22% validator market share self-limit, thereby ensuring a diversified and decentralized network.

This may bring ETH+ closer to its mandate.

11/

In this way, ETH+ could solve the concerns shared by so many.

As ever though, the ultimate decision for this matter rests with those staking RSR onto ETH+ as stakers receive voting power.

12/
To conclude, changing backing may fulfill ETH+'s mandate to positively impact staking distribution more than currently.

It will create a more diversified index of staking tokens, reduce Lido dominance and bring other benefits RTokens provide such as overcollateralization.

13/

What are the Reserve community's thoughts on this? Should ETH+ governors begin the path to this goal or is it too reactionary?
