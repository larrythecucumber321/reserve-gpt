âœ¨ Time to celebrate!

We're thrilled to announce that the Option 2 token unlock for $RSR has been completed since April 10th, marking the end of all scheduled RSR token unlocks.

Let's look at what this means ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/WAYBY3uAfg

Since January 29th 2022, the Reserve project started unlocking a total of 31.2b RSR tokens across two unlocking options. These unlocks are now complete, leaving the circulating supply at 50.6b.

This marks the end of the originally scheduled RSR unlocks âœ¨

The total RSR supply can now very easily be divided in two groups:

ðŸ”µ Circulating supply: 50.6%
ðŸ”µ Slow Wallet: 49.4%

The core team has discretion on when Slow Wallet tokens are unlocked. Any unlocking comes with an announcement and a 4-week delay.

We want to express our gratitude to the community for their support and patience throughout the RSR unlocking process.

We're excited to move forward with a fully unlocked supply of 50.6b RSR, and look forward to the continued growth and success of the Reserve project! ðŸ’ª
