Big news for stablecoin farmers üë®‚Äçüåæ

@ConvexFinance collateral plugins are arriving to Reserve. This introduces RToken possibilities delivering the highest yields yet

But first, what is Convex? https://t.co/hwphaLGWzR

@CurveFinance pioneered a voting-escrow governance token model whereby CRV holders could lock CRV for up to 4 years, gaining access to boosted yields &amp; trading fees

Convex allows Curve liquidity providers to earn boosted CRV rewards without locking tokens themselves

The socialized rewards boost created by Convex enables every day farmers earn some of the safest and attractive yields in DeFi by aligning incentives within the Curve ecosystem https://t.co/Oq6shYFfV8

To start, 4 plugins will be available:

- cvxMIM3Pool
- cvx3Pool
- cvxTriCrypto
- cvxeUSDFRAXBP

You may notice an old friend here - eUSD! This show just one way RTokens can be used as a lego within composable DeFi leverage

The Convex plugins are also a little different from the ones available thus far. For example, @AaveAave &amp; @FluxFinance collateral are represented by a single token

With Convex, we have Curve liquidity tokens which can come in a number of flavors: StableSwap, Meta, Crypto pools

Why does this matter? Well you may recall that assets within RToken baskets are rigorously priced to ensure proper detection of when RTokens' self-healing needs to kick in in the event of default

This isn't so hard for Aave lending tokens, but what about a pool of 3 tokens? https://t.co/c4Ug2OO5GZ

These are the general conditions for default for Convex plugins:

1.  the peg for an underlying token falls below its target (e.g. DAI depegging)

2.  an invariant of the Curve LP token fails (e.g. get_virtual_price() falls, which should only increase)

3.  the ratio of tokens in the pool falls below a certain amount (e.g. DAI falls to 10% relative weight in 3pool)

There's configurability in defining additional (or modifying) default conditions to tailor plugins to your needs. See here for specifics:
