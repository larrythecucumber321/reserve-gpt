8/ This part of this diagram covers how $RSR is staked onto an RToken to overcollateralize it in case of an underlying collateral depeg.

Once the RToken detects the collateral has depegged, it sells the staked $RSR for emergency collateral - more on that later.

9/ Read on about how $eUSD, an RToken, dealt with $USDC's depeg:

✅ How it recapitalized holders before $USDC did
✅ How stakers providing first loss capital have been made whole

This diagram section identifies the mechanism with which RTokens protect the wealth they create. https://t.co/cuBiCfJAEk
