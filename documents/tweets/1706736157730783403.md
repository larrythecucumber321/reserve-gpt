Title: 1706736157730783403

1/ Yield is on our mind this week!

Let's double click on how @yearnfi uses RTokens to power some of the strategies covered in weekly yield updates.

What is actually going on under the hood? How are they generating these  returns? Does this include native RToken yield? https://t.co/rS7ONEiWTL

2/ Yearn operates vaults which compound farming yield into users' original positions, and is one of the most respected OG contributors to DeFi. More at https://t.co/sM0gDCZbIR

RTokens are asset backed currencies deployed using Reserve Protocol.  https://t.co/olmoY68tj4

3/ Yearn has vaults for two RTokens: @ETHPlus_ and @HighYieldUSD.

To learn about ETH+, a diversified ETH staking index, read here https://t.co/t6nakH55mf

To learn about hyUSD, a Reserve-powered flatcoin, read https://t.co/mSo0zfIO3H

4/ The first RToken strategy @yearnfi employs is with RToken @HighYieldUSD.  So far, the hyUSD vault has generated some 6340 hyUSD-eUSD CRV tokens which are paid to Yearn users depositing into this vault.

This strategy can be viewed at https://t.co/lqhyvVpB2d https://t.co/I1vZ6ULtzK

5/ How does it work?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Yearn wraps hyUSD and eUSD into an LP token and supplies it to a @CurveFinance pool

2Ô∏è‚É£ It stakes the token into a Curve gauge to earn fees and CRV rewards

3Ô∏è‚É£ Finally, Yearn swaps the earned tokens for more hyUSD-eUSD LP tokens and redeposit per step 1Ô∏è‚É£ https://t.co/GBVZga56sG

6/ If you're unfamiliar with how Curve gauges work, check out this article on them. https://t.co/quVgVBI3Fh

7/~179,000$ is held in this Yearn vault and has earned $6,340 using the method described above.

This is 15% annualized, no small feat considering they're dollar stables with little impermanent loss.

Well done to the strategists that put this one together!

8/ Note that does not include native $hyUSD yield, estimated at 4.39%. Since this LP token is 50% $hyUSD and 50% $eUSD, this yield is split in half ($eUSD is not yield bearing for holders).

This native yield increases the yield to ~17% for this strategy in real terms! https://t.co/iXhC24GX4k

9/ The next RToken vault is a similar one, only this time using ETH+. It has earned some 5.39 ETH-ETH+ LP tokens, which have been distributed to those using Yearn to perform this strategy.

The strategy can be viewed at https://t.co/qTAtc5Ho6F https://t.co/3gRQeTx2Lu

10/ It works in a similar way:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Wrap ETH+ and ETH into an LP token and supply it to a @CurveFinance pool

2Ô∏è‚É£ Stake it into a Curve gauge to earn fees and token emissions

3Ô∏è‚É£ Swap the earned tokens for more ETH+-ETH LP tokens and redeposit them per step 1Ô∏è‚É£

11/ This strategy has 189 ETH-ETH+ LP tokens deposited into it and has generated 5 ETH-ETH+ tokens using this 3 part strategy.

In doing so, the strategy has an APR of 13.78% which is paid to depositors. This strategy also has low imperanent loss, making it attractive to farmers. https://t.co/0IH50GeG0y

12/ As ever, this does not include native $ETH+ yield, estimated at 3.36%.

Half of this (as the LP token is paired 50% ETH+ and 50% ETH) native yield makes the total yield ~15% for this strategy in real terms! This is notable for an ETH-based vault. https://t.co/F1Ri4h9uLX

13/ Yearn uses these two vaults to deliver yield to @ETHPlus_ and @HighYieldUSD holders and boosts liquidity for both RTokens - thereby strengthening the RToken ecosystem.

14/ Next under the yield microscope is @StakeDAOHQ, the recent entrant stampeding into RToken Yield Updates üêòüêòüêò
