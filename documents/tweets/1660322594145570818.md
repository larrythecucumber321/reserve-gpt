Title: 1660322594145570818

Recently, a governance fault led to a temporary halt of @AaveAave on Polygon. Funds remain safe, and we applaud Aave DAO's prompt response

Let's see how this situation would've played out with an RToken that held affected aTokens as collateral üîéüßµüëá https://t.co/xS3olnQ45U

2/ The bug came from an interest rate patch across all v2 deployments https://t.co/wbyDPqyJj9

The Polygon implementation uses slightly different interfaces compared to Ethereum's. The bug prevents users from withdrawing/depositing on Polygon until the pending patch is applied

3/ In a hypothetical RToken that had these [paused] Aave Polygon collateral, two outcomes are possible:

  ‚àô assets are marked as defaulted -&gt; defend peg and recollaterlizae
  ‚àô no change to RToken operation -&gt; governance can decide to wait it out or rebalance to other assets

4/ Scenario #1: aToken collateral defaults ‚ùå

From Reserve's perspective, the aToken appears fully healthy - it remains transferable, and maintains its pricing integrity

It's only downstream when withdrawing from Aave that issues arise, invisible to Reserve

5/ Quick RToken default refresher:

Typically, a default is triggered if a collateral asset depegs relative to its reference (e.g. aUSDT -&gt; USDT) or if the reference depegs relative to its target (USDT -&gt; USD)

6/ Reserve's aTokens look at the "normalized income" of the lending market to determine the price of the aToken collateral

Checking Aave's aUSDT market would suggest nothing is awry https://t.co/avySpNEotU

As USDT remains pegged, Reserve's default checks pass https://t.co/ceEXXdUwqU

7/ Scenario #2: Wait and see ‚úÖ

RToken operations would carry on as usual and RToken redemptions will return owed aToken collateral to users

It's up to RToken governance to decide whether to rebalance or wait it out (likely wait if a fix is imminent, as with Aave)

8/ To summarize, even though there are disruptions in protocols relied on by Reserve, RToken deposits/withdrawals remain unaffected

This experiment highlights the robustness of the Reserve Protocol during unforeseen situations, and the power of governance to intervene if needed

9/ To clarify, the protocol response could vary depending on how the collateral asset is priced

With Aave's Polygon incident, the collateral price is preserved, leading to the present conclusion

However, other bugs may yield different outcomes and we always remain vigilant üßê
