1/ October's Community Education Rewards results are here - well done to all who entered!

This month's focus was heavily centered on Base, given that the Reserve Protocol deployed there. It was a particularly star-studded line up this month with 9 contributors - let's dig in! https://t.co/8ScurGRMwe

2/ @ShivanshuMadan's contribution about the potential for flatcoins on Base took the spotlight this month.

This thread did a great job of joining the dots to other threads and documentation, as well as gave a few new ideas. There was a focus on data and charts, which we like! https://t.co/iqa0Kn1HHw

3/ Next up came @stacy_muur's long post about Reserve's resilience when it comes to keeping RToken pegs.

This educational content raises an original point about the "creator economy for money" then dovetails it with a graphic so beautiful even the original designers were amazed! https://t.co/0bd9fmlrlJ

4/ @0xFinish brought this introductory ðŸ§µ about Reserve and how Base presents many opportunities for the growth on inflation proof money.

It also recognizes the importance of low gas fees for the protocol to be meaningfully adopted as these can eat into yields! https://t.co/YFtoHDqDe4

5/ Up next comes longtime contributor @DefiVaults, whose thread pays close attention to Reserve's arrival on Base.

As usual, their analysis is sharp, readable and educational.  Their use of @l2beat data to explain the opportunity Base presents is especially convincing! https://t.co/DEXHlfGR6v

6/ Another regular contributor this month is @stakedqueen, who rightly notes that @HighYieldUSD (hyUSD), an RToken deployed with Reserve protocol on Base, is answering @brian_armstrong's call for flatcoins. https://t.co/Jz8jYulHI9

7/ @Baseinsider_TIG's welcome post to the Base network did a fine job explaining how Reserve's onchain governance processes result in a robust currency ecosystem as well as how the protocol might fit into @BuildonBase network. https://t.co/5z8ne7gKso

8/ @SotoPerregil,  one of the most faithful Reserve contributors,  explains how Reserve landing on Base will enable a new stage for the protocol.

A huge amount of work went into this one! Custom graphics, cost / benefit analyses and much more do well to educate. https://t.co/eqeyoB7r2s

9/ Our penultimate contributor is regular @dserrano1. His piece explains how Reserve mitigates inflation through yield-bearing collateral and how Base's low transaction fees help this effort. It is very educational! https://t.co/RxocYCuKhl

10/ The final highlight of the month was Reserve stalwart @fennecstuff's simple but effective GIF celebrating 1 year of Reserve on mainnet - an important date.

More generally, we'd love to see more meme submissions in the future! https://t.co/cJAwUvUlPj
