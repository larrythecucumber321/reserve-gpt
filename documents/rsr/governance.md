Title: RToken Governance

While each RToken can have its own customized governance system, we expect most RTokens to use our default configuration where the amount of RSR tokens a participant holds serves as the voting weight.

If an RToken’s overcollateralization & governance is both done by RSR token holders, there is the incentive for the RSR governance participants to keep the RToken as safe as possible, rather than taking unnecessary risk with the collateral, as it’s their funds that would be seized first if any of the RToken’s collateral were to default.

The governance process designed by Reserve follows a transparent and democratic approach. It allows holders of RSR, to propose, discuss, and vote on changes to the protocol.

It is designed to be community-driven, which means anyone can propose changes to modify or improve an RToken. Once a proposal is submitted, RSR holders vote on it. If the proposal passes and meets the required criteria, the code to update the RToken can be executed (after a pre-defined delay period).

Governor Alexios is the protocol's recommended governor implementation, which is detailed next.
