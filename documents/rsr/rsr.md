Title: Reserve Rights (RSR)

Reserve Rights (RSR) is an ERC20 token common across all Reserve tokens (RTokens). RSR can be staked on a particular RToken, where it has two roles:

Staked RSR receives a portion of the RToken collateral’s revenue in exchange for being the first capital-at-risk in the case of collateral default.
Staked RSR proposes and votes on changes to the RToken’s configuration.

All the relevant information regarding RSR’s supply, release schedule, audits, etc. can be found through the links below:
